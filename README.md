# TFG - APLICATION TO FACILITATE THE USE OF AN ANDROID PHONE IN THE ELDERLY

## Abstract

This work describes the specification, design and implementation of an application to facilitate the use of a mobile phone by the elderly. Although the application is aimed at the elderly, since they are usually the ones who have more complications with the use of new technologies, it can also be used by those with little knowledge or difficulties due to some disability.
The application provides the user with a simple interface consisting of different functional modules. The user will have the possibility to make phone calls, both through a dialer and through his or her favourite contacts, including a contact list that can be modified. They will also have the possibility of creating a home screen where they can add the applications they use most or display a list of these. Finally, the user will have access to a medication reminder, where he or she will see the medications to take each day, as well as a complete list. It is also easy to add, edit and delete new medicines.


## User guide

### Launcher

To start using the application, the first step is to go to the main menu of the device and look for the SimpleLauncher application, which has a rocket icon. Once located, you have to click on it to open it.
Once opened, as the application does not require any login, it will be up and running. The next step the user has to do is to press the home button of the phone, this way the mobile will recognise the launcher and will ask the user if he/she wants to set the application as the start-up application. The user must choose the "Always" option.

</p>

The first time we start the application, an empty desktop will be displayed, with only the time and a button that will take us to the applications box. Clicking on it will open a list of installed applications, and by means of the button with the three dots located at the top, the shortcuts, their order and the screen background can be modified.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192813927-2e043183-9ef0-421b-a3ad-18b5ead7b08e.png" />

</p>

To change the shortcuts, the user must click on the "Edit mode" option. Once this has been done, a checkbox will appear in each application, which the user must click on if he/she wants to add an application. Once the desired applications have been selected, the three dots button can be clicked again to exit. When this action has been carried out, an informative message will appear on the screen.

</p>


To change the order in which the applications appear in the main menu, the user must click on the "Sort Mode" option. Now only those applications with direct access will appear and the user must interact with the arrows to change the order. As with the previous option, a message will appear on the screen when finished.

</p>

### Phone

Now, to access the call module, the user must click on the icon of a telephone with the name "SimpleCall". As soon as you open it, you will be asked for some permissions that you will have to accept. If you have any contacts stored on the device, they will appear directly. The same applies to the call log. To navigate through the module, the user must press the buttons at the top.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816460-51f372b9-041d-4ecc-a2a7-4a7f9a0d2766.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816473-39554a0b-0dee-4440-abd6-8d29e4b2a1f3.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816487-1a5d583d-91f9-40b3-9c95-2561bd2be8cc.png" />
</p>


To view the details of a contact, the user must go to the "Phonebook" section and select a user. To call the contact, the user must press the call button. To edit the contact, the user must click on the icon with the pencil located in the lower right corner. Once the editing is done, the user must press the save icon. You can also delete the contact by pressing the bin button.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816732-e0acf03f-8da8-4099-a1ce-31912b7a493e.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816754-bbb3c266-f1e2-40ad-bdbb-7faa1b7ee757.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816765-f6de715f-7856-4cea-a7dd-d23c6ae8bd1d.png" />
</p>


It is also possible to make a call from the favourites tab or the call log. In this case, simply click on the desired contact. 
If the user wishes, a manual telephone dialling can be performed via the icon at the bottom of the main screen. The user must enter the number and press the call button.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192816975-55cd7c37-c646-4de2-a16d-9c1669208487.png" />

</p>


Finally, the user will be able to add new contacts from the phonebook view. Just click on the "Add a contact" button at the top of the screen. This will open a new window to fill in the details of the new contact. To save it, click on the green button.

<p align="center">

</p>


### Medicine

To access the medicines module, the user must press the home button on their device and look for the application with the pill icon, called "SimpleMedicine". As soon as the application starts, there will be no medicine, so the user will have to press the orange button in the bottom right corner to add a new one.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817586-2cb32630-3f1a-45e7-9bd8-2f8585b384b5.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817599-f8125ed8-d148-46a2-a060-3f026c1bf61f.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817616-00392a7f-34c7-405d-95ae-8cd1f7212d94.png" />
</p>


The user must now fill in the different screens, progressing by clicking on the "Next" button.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817782-633eee5f-3dfc-4492-adcd-c22a6becadb4.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817800-13e8c295-a52f-4418-9c34-176894efb041.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817813-95f0ca11-c0b2-4196-95f2-95f1546bcbca.png" />
</p>


When the user reaches the last screen, he/she should click on the "Save" button. Now you can see how the medicine appears in the list of medicines and, if you have filled it in, the corresponding notification will also appear.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817981-cbb660f0-9282-4392-8867-f98f2d250c89.png" />
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192817995-18ae54c0-81c9-4519-a375-e7590dcbe238.png" />

</p>


The user can now view the details of a medicine by tapping on it. In addition, the user can also edit or delete it using the three dots icon at the top. The editing process is identical to adding a new medicine with the difference that the fields are filled in.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192818185-3ff6452c-ceee-4ecb-9bae-a1c5c89c566d.png" />

</p>


The user will be able to mark as completed those notifications whose medication has already been taken. Simply click on the button with the green check, which will be disabled. If you have several medicines with the same time, they will be grouped together in the same notification.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856260/192818407-f9ff1b2c-b966-47ff-8684-c531379f249c.png" />

</p>


Finally, the application will send a notification to the user to alert them to take their medication.

</p>


## Conclusions

Users, through a simple and intuitive interface, will be able to perform basic management of a contact list, make phone calls, launch third-party applications, and manage their medication without depending on another person. 
The application is designed for people with little knowledge in the use of mobile applications but trying to maintain a certain freedom for those with more experience.
It is considered that the application developed here fulfils the general objectives that were set out and, in general, contributes a grain of sand for all those people who are affected by the technological gap.


## Future work

The functionality of the project could be improved in the following way:
-	Evaluation with users: The most interesting thing for the future is to carry out an evaluation with users, since in the end they are the ones who are going to make use of the application and they can give us an idea of how they feel and with what actions should be taken to improve the application.
-	Configuration of the application: For greater adaptability to users, the application could integrate a settings service in which they could configure everything from the size of the text to limiting the actions that the user can perform on the application. This would be useful for adapting to end users, depending on their physical capabilities.
-	Voice accessibility: Currently, the application is controlled using the screen, so users with reduced vision may have difficulty using it. An interesting solution would be to enable a button through which, by means of previously learned commands, the application can be controlled almost completely. For example, when adding a contact, it could be dictated to the phone and fill in the fields automatically. 
-	Improved notifications: The medication module informs the user that he/she should take his/her medication, but so far does not provide concrete information.
-	Video calls: Due to the pandemic, many elderly people were isolated during the confinement and, although it is something that hopefully will not happen again, it would be interesting to extend the functionality of the call module so that while talking on the phone they can also see each other's faces. 
-	Doctor's appointments: It would be interesting to add an extra tab in the medication module that allows users to add doctor's appointments, so they would appear in today's tab as well as the medications. 
-	Medication history: Another interesting functionality for the medication module would be the possibility of keeping a medication history using the system's calendar. 
-	Error reporting: Finally, a section could be developed to report errors or make suggestions from users to improve the application.
