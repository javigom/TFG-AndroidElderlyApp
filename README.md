# TFG - APLICATION TO FACILITATE THE USE OF AN ANDROID PHONE IN THE ELDERLY

This work describes the specification, design and implementation of an application to facilitate the use of a mobile phone by the elderly. Although the application is aimed at the elderly, since they are usually the ones who have more complications with the use of new technologies, it can also be used by those with little knowledge or difficulties due to some disability.
The application provides the user with a simple interface consisting of different functional modules. The user will have the possibility to make phone calls, both through a dialer and through his or her favourite contacts, including a contact list that can be modified. They will also have the possibility of creating a home screen where they can add the applications they use most or display a list of these. Finally, the user will have access to a medication reminder, where he or she will see the medications to take each day, as well as a complete list. It is also easy to add, edit and delete new medicines.
